    Below you will find the current All-Time Rankings for the ALA March Madness Pool. Due to the constraints of embedded Google Sheets (e.g., an inability to freeze rows/columns or zoom out within the workbook), it is <b>highly</b> recommended that you <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L8f_erDr2XQRXU_9DGwGZmb0t-gxSDOHniofiCMGD-8/edit#gid=651901097" target="_blank">click here</a> to open the full version of the rankings in their own separate window, as they are much easier to read that way. Within the file, there is a main left-hand section showing career stats, and as you scroll right you will see each entrant's results for each season.

    <b> Ranking Methodology</b>: Entrants are first ranked by the number of years they have played in the pool and then by their average score over that time period.
