      <b>When I was eight years old</b>, my dad enlisted me to help him with his team in the ‘Celebrity Division’ of the Portland Oregonian’s Fantasy Basketball League. Fantasy basketball <hoopsPopover popover-append-to-body="true" uib-popover-html="htmlPopover" popover-trigger="mouseenter" popover-placement="right-top"> worked a bit differently back then</hoopsPopover>. We won that league — getting props in the newspaper and having a trophy presented to us in the company of the rest of the league’s ‘celebrities’ — and so began my lifelong love affair with fantasy sports. Today, in my spare time, <b>I run A Level Above</b>, a non-profit organization which has grown from humble origins as a casual league between high-school buddies into a year-round gauntlet of pools, fantasy games, and competitions that has paid out over $110,000 in prizes. This website serves as the <a ui-sref="home.ala.blog.main" ng-click="vm.gotoId('aboutTop')">homepage of the ALA universe</a>.

      At age 16, <b>I realized my dream of becoming a rock star</b>. The Xpletives were <i>easily</i> the third- or fourth-coolest garage band (of about six) at Lake Oswego High School. Though we never quite followed in our heroes' footsteps and played the main stage at Warped Tour, music has remained essential to my life in the years since, and sharing it with others -- both as a live experience and as a method of discovery -- is such a passion of mine that there’s a page on this site <a ui-sref="home.music" ng-click="vm.gotoId('aboutTop')">dedicated to doing just that</a>. When I'm not coding, you can usually find me at club shows around Seattle or festivals around the country.

    <p>
      I went to Italy for the first time when I was 19. My late grandfather’s parents emigrated to the U.S. from a tiny town called Gioi in southwestern Italy, and my parents both studied in Venice; my family’s Italian heritage is rich. By the time that trip ended, I had little doubt that I wanted to follow in my parents’ footsteps, and I spent the spring of my junior year of college <italyPopover popover-append-to-body="true" uib-popover-html="italyPopover" popover-trigger="mouseenter" popover-placement="right-top">'studying'</italyPopover> in Florence with Gonzaga University. <b>It was the best four months of my life</b>. It instilled in me a passion for culture, travel and photography that guides many of the decisions I make today, and I currently live in Seattle, WA largely because that’s where many of my Florence classmates ended up. These days, I'm always looking for the next journey to take with my camera in tow, and my travel photography is proudly displayed here.

    <p>
      Today, I find myself on a career path that I’m legitimately excited about. I’ve always been passionate about solving problems and driven by a devotion to logic, patterns, and formulae (from an early age, my friends liked to mock me by telling me to “go make a spreadsheet.”). <b>Coding allows me to use the gifts that come most naturally to me</b> to achieve the kinds of creative visions that I've always seeked to achieve. Web development is the unity and culmination of my passions in life, and I can't wait to see where it takes me.
