      <b>When I was eight years old</b>, my dad enlisted me to help him with his team in the ‘Celebrity Division’ of the Portland Oregonian’s Fantasy Basketball League. Fantasy basketball <hoopsPopover popover-append-to-body="true" uib-popover-html="htmlPopover" popover-trigger="mouseenter" popover-placement="right-top" popover-is-open="hoopsPopIsOpen" ng-click="hoopsPopIsOpen = !hoopsPopIsOpen"> worked a bit differently back then</hoopsPopover>. We won that league — getting props in the newspaper and having a trophy presented to us in the company of the rest of the league’s ‘celebrities’ — and so began my lifelong love affair with fantasy sports. Today, in my spare time, <b>I run A Level Above</b>, a non-profit organization which has grown from humble origins as a casual league between high-school friends into a year-round gauntlet of pools, fantasy games, and competitions that has paid out over $118,000 in prizes. This website serves as the <a ui-sref="home.ala.blog.main">homepage of the ALA universe</a>.

      At age 16, <b>I realized my dream of becoming a rock star</b>. With our own -- ahem -- 'unique' blend of emo and pop-punk, the Xpletives took the Lake Oswego High School music scene by storm and became local legends after career-defining shows at the Tully's Coffee on A Avenue and the local Farmer's Market. Though we never quite followed in our heroes' footsteps and played the main stage at Warped Tour, music has remained essential to my life in the years since, and sharing it with others -- both as a live experience and as a method of discovery -- is such a passion of mine that there’s a page on this site <a ui-sref="home.music">dedicated to doing just that</a>. When I'm not coding, you can usually find me at club shows around Seattle or at festivals around the country.

    <p>
      I have a rich Italian heritage; my late grandfather’s parents emigrated to the U.S. from a tiny town called Gioi in southwestern Italy, and my parents both studied in Venice when they were students. They took me to Italy for the first time when I was 19. By the time that trip ended, I had little doubt that I wanted to follow in their footsteps, and I spent the spring semester of my junior year of college <italyPopover popover-append-to-body="true" uib-popover-html="italyPopover" popover-trigger="mouseenter" popover-is-open="italyPopIsOpen" ng-click="italyPopIsOpen = !italyPopIsOpen" popover-placement="left-top">'studying'</italyPopover> in Florence with Gonzaga University. <b>It was the best four months of my life</b>. It instilled in me a passion for culture, travel and photography that guides many of the decisions I make today, and I currently live in Seattle, WA largely because that’s where many of my Florence classmates ended up. These days, I'm always looking for the next journey to take with my camera in tow, and my travel photography is proudly displayed <a href="http://photography.mikeduin.com">here</a>.

      And now? Now, I build websites. I’ve always been passionate about solving problems and driven by a devotion to logic, patterns, and formulae (in junior high, my friends liked to mock me by telling me to “go make a spreadsheet” ... I suppose there are worse insults). <b>Coding enables me to use the gifts that come most naturally to me</b> to maximize my creative abilities. A career in web development feels like it has limitless potential, and I'm excited to see where it takes me.
