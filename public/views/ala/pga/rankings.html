    Below you will find the All-Time Rankings for the PGA Majors Game. Due to the constraints of embedded Google Sheets (e.g., an inability to freeze rows/columns or zoom out within the workbook), it is <b>highly</b> recommended that you <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BNfQy8f-jdKnctHAYb0qByNS5aRYo_OfaYc5ljV9jx8/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">click here</a> to open the full version of the rankings in their own separate window, as they are much easier to read that way. Within the file, there is a main left-hand section showing career stats, and as you scroll right you will see each entrant's results for each season.
