    Below you will find the current All-Time Rankings for the ALA March Madness Pool. Due to the constraints of embedded Google Sheets (e.g., an inability to freeze rows/columns or zoom out within the workbook), it is <b>highly</b> recommended that you <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L8f_erDr2XQRXU_9DGwGZmb0t-gxSDOHniofiCMGD-8/edit#gid=651901097" target="_blank">click here</a> to open the full version of the rankings in their own separate window, as they are much easier to read that way. Within the file, there is a main left-hand section showing career stats, and as you scroll right you will see each entrant's results for each season.

    <b> Ranking Methodology</b>: These rankings have recently been revised and are now structured as follows. First, entrants are divided into two tiers: (a) entrants who have played in 3+ pools, and (b) entrants who have played in one or two pools. From there, entrants are now ranked by the '% of Opponents Defeated' in their pool careers. Previously, entrants were ranked by Average Score, but this methodology inflated the ranking of entrants who participated in the pool in years in which more likely events took place (or in which more "chalk" or higher seeds prevailed). The goal with these rankings is to evaluate an entrant's performance relative to their competition, and ranking by % of Opponents Defeated accomplishes that.
