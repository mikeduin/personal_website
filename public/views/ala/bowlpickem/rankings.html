    Below you will find the current All-Time Rankings for NCAA Bowl Pick'em. Due to the constraints of embedded Google Sheets (e.g., an inability to freeze rows/columns or zoom out within the workbook), it is <b>highly</b> recommended that you <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vC1SxazEljPDzFHr-X0NZXNFlAwDyHoNITYynD0-Uds/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">click here</a> to open the full version of the rankings in their own separate window, as they are much easier to read that way. Within the file, there is a main left-hand section showing career stats, and as you scroll right you will see each entrant's results for each season.

    <b> Ranking Methodology</b>: Entrants are divided into two tiers -- (a) those who have played in 2+ seasons and (b) those who have played in one season -- and then sorted by the percentage of the pool that they defeated over the course of their careers.
