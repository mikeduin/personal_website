        <td class="details text-left" style="padding-top:0px"> The <b>NBA Survivor</b> Pool debuted in late 2019 as the inaugural event of the <a href="https://www.alasurvivorseries.com" target="_blank"><b>ALA Survivor Series</b></a> and is an original, built-from-scratch pool offering that aims to expand and build on the traditional Survivor format and create a more immersive, exciting game experience. In NBA Survivor, your aim is to pick one NBA team to go .500 or better each week of the season. If your selection suceeds in winning at least as many games as they lose, you advance to the next week, with the standard Survivor rub that you are not able to use any team more than once over the course of the season. In NBA Survivor, you are afforded three lives, and if you fail to advance your two additional lives are at your disposal for the cost of a rebuy. Additionally, entrants have the opportunity to opt-in to the Performance Bonus Pool, which awards prizes based on statistical feats achieved by an entrant's weekly selection. Integration with the NBA's Box Score API allows for live scoring, which updates game results and statistics in real time on the Scoreboard page, and the application is chock-full of reporting features and bits of analysis that go above and beyond the offerings of ... well, pretty much everyone. The game has changed. </td>
