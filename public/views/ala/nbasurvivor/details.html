        <td class="details text-left" style="padding-top:0px"> The <a href="https://www.alasurvivorseries.com" target="_blank"><b>ALA Survivor Series</b></a>, launched in 2019, is ALA's defining product: an original, built-from-the-ground-up application capable of hosting both the global ALA NBA & MLB Survivor Pools and acting as free, customizable software for anyone who would like to use the platform to host their own NBA/MLB Surviror Pool. In both NBA and MLB Survivor, your aim is to pick just one team per week to go .500 or better. If your selection suceeds in winning at least as many games as they lose, you advance to the next week, with the standard Survivor rub that you are not able to use any team more than once over the course of the season. In ALA's global pools, you are afforded three lives over the course of the season, and if you fail to advance in a given week, you can rebuy provided you have any of those lives remaining (that configuration and many others are customizable with the creation of a new pool). Entrants also have the opportunity to opt-in to the Performance Bonus Pool, which awards prizes based on statistical feats achieved by an entrant's weekly team selection. Integration with the MLB and NBA's native box score APIs allows for live scoring and real-time updates on the Scoreboard page, and the application is chock-full of reporting features and bits of analysis that go above and beyond the offerings of ... well, pretty much everyone. The Survivor game has changed. </td>
