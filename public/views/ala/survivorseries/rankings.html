    Below you will find the current All-Time Rankings for the ALA Survivor Series. Due to the constraints of embedded Google Sheets (e.g., an inability to freeze rows/columns or zoom out within the workbook), it is <b>highly</b> recommended that you <b><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MjdKXrytvI3r9jNsJudpGbJb-E4AhQgnM6M3ysSwQ3M/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">click here</a></b> to open the full version of the rankings in their own separate window, as they are much easier to read that way. Within the file, there is a main left-hand section showing career stats, and as you scroll right you will see each entrant's results for each season.

    <b> Ranking Methodology</b>: Entrants are ranked by total game prizes, and then game entries, and then game net profits.
