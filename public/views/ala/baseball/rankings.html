    Below you will find the current All-Time Rankings for ALA Fantasy Baseball. Due to the constraints of embedded Google Sheets (e.g., an inability to freeze rows/columns or zoom out within the workbook), it is <b>highly</b> recommended that you <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tA7iPrS4Byig7woce8ihKZP0Z7fS_nsxWbukd6PhbAA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">click here</a> to open the full version of the rankings in their own separate window, as they are much easier to read that way. Within the file, there is a main left-hand section showing career stats, and as you scroll right you will see each entrant's results for each season.

      <b> <u> A Note on 'Effective'/Normalized Rotisserie Scores </u> </b>
      <br>
      Due to the varying number of teams and Roto Points available in each season, included in each season's stats -- and incorporated into the Career Roto rankings -- are normalized Roto Scores displayed as "Effective Hitting," "Effective Pitching," and "Effective Total" scores. These metrics convert each Roto Score to an equivalent scale, scored from 0.67 - 10.0, which measures the percentage of Roto Points that a team amasses relative to the total number of Roto Points available in a given season.  For example: if a team led the league in every hitting category in a given season, their <i>effHit</i> score for that season would be 10.0. If a team earned exactly half of all available hitting points, their <i>effHit</i> score would be 5.0; if a team got last in every hitting category, their <i>effHit</i> score would be 0.67 (it is 0.67 rather than 0.00 because last place in every category gets one point, so a team with the minimum number of points across all categories would still have 10 points). The scale works the same way for Pitching and Total Roto scores.

      <br>
      These numbers for each season are then weighed against the number of Roto Points available in the CURRENT season to give each manager a Best, Worst, and Average Roto Score in the 'Career Roto' section, and each manager's Average Score is then used as the basis for their Career Roto ranking. This normalized scale is necessary so that owners are not rewarded or penalized for playing in seasons in which there are more or less teams or roto points available than in other seasons. Each manager's Best, Worst, and Average Roto Scores should not be taken at face value, but instead interpreted as scores <b> <i> relative to the league's current scoring parameters </b> </i> <i>(e.g., Joe Simich's best fantasy team could be expected to score 101 points in the current league format)</i>. - The Commish
