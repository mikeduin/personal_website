        Welcome to ALA's latest original pool offering: a 2018 World Cup Bracket Pool which can already lay claim to being the littest World Cup Bracket Pool in all the internet. To get started, you will first need to register for an ALA account if you have not already done so (if you played in last year's <a ui-sref="home.ala.btb.details">NFL Battle the Bookies</a>, the same login will work). Once you've done that, start with the <a ui-sref="home.ala.wc18bracket.groups">Group Stage</a>, where you will use the <i class="fas fa-arrow-up"></i> and <i class="fas fa-arrow-down"></i> arrows that are next to each team to rearrange the groups by the order in which you think the teams will finish. Once you've saved those picks, head over to the <a ui-sref="home.ala.wc18bracket.bracket">Bracket Stage</a>, where you will see all of the group winners and runners-up that you selected in the Group Stage. Click a team to advance them through the bracket. Once you've completed your bracket, save your picks and you're all set. You are free to modify any of your picks until Russia and Saudi Arabia kick things off at 8 AM PDT on Thursday, June 14th.

        There are 250 possible points at stake in the game, with 120 coming from the Group Stage and 130 coming from the Bracket Stage. Points will be awarded as follows:
