        Welcome to <b>ALA's World Cup Bracket Pool</b>. Built from the ground up by ALA engineers and without an ounce of help from foreign slave laborers, it has brought hardened men to tears; many have said it's the internet's greatest World Cup Bracket Pool. Here's how to get going: </p>
        <p>- First, you'll need to <a ui-sref="home.ala.loginpop">login or create</a> an ALA account if you have not previously done so (it's the same login you use for <a href="http://www.alabattlethebookies.com" target="blank">Battle the Bookies</a>, the <a href='https://www.alasurvivorseries.com' target="_blank">ALA Survivor Series</a>, etc. -- if you can't remember your password you can reset it <a href='https://www.alabattlethebookies.com/forgot-password' target='blank'>here</a> or <a ui-sref="home.ala.contact" target="blank">reach out to me</a> for help). </p>
        
        <p>- Once you've logged in, head to the <a ui-sref="home.ala.pools">Pools</a> page to register for the game.</p> 
        <p>- Start making your picks with the <a ui-sref="home.ala.wc18bracket.groups">Group Stage</a>, where you will use the <i class="fas fa-arrow-up"></i> and <i class="fas fa-arrow-down"></i> arrows that are next to each team to rearrange the Groups by the order in which you think the teams will finish.</p> 
        <p>- <i>After you've saved your Group Stage picks</i>, head over to the <a ui-sref="home.ala.wc18bracket.bracket">Bracket Stage</a>, where you will see all of the Group winners and runners-up that you selected in the Group Stage. Click on a team to advance them through the bracket. Once you've completed your bracket, save your picks and you're all set. You are free to modify any of your picks until Qatar and Ecuador kick things off at 8 AM PDT on Sunday, November 20th.</p>
      </p>

        There are 250 possible points at stake in the game, with 120 coming from the Group Stage and 130 coming from the Bracket Stage. Points will be awarded as follows:
