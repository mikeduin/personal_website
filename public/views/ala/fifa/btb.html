      A fun bit of ALA trivia: though it's <a href="https://www.alabattlethebookies.com" target="_blank">now an annual NFL competition run through custom-built software</a> and one of ALA's most popular games, Battle the Bookies made its ALA original debut for the 2014 FIFA World Cup after the Commish came up with the idea as another fun way to follow the tournament. The game's premise requires each entrant to make a theoretical $100 bet on each World Cup game. That fake $100 bet can be made one of three ways: on either team's moneyline (their odds of winning the game outright), on the match ending in a draw, or on over or under the line for the total number of goals scored in the game. If your bet wins, your game score is credited with the payout amount that was specified when you made your bet; if your bet loses, your game score is docked -$100. The standings are then sorted by each entrant's overall total.

      For the first time in 2022, BTB will now run through the same software used for the NFL software -- head on over to the <a href="https://www.alabattlethebookies.com" target="_blank">BTB website</a> to join.

      Below you will find an embedded worksheet detailing showing the pool results from the 2014 game. As always, due to the constraints of embedded Google Sheets (e.g., an inability to freeze rows/columns or zoom out within the workbook), it is <b>highly</b> recommended that you <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DLME6RyIXuIoYowQ7K0EmUYPajEQQuXlHTOjp16W8Vs/edit#gid=867273349" target="_blank">click here</a> to open the full version of the spreadsheet in its own separate window, as its much easier to read that way.
