        <td class="details text-left" style="padding-top:0px">  <b>Fantasy Football</b> ... ALA uses a unique, revelatory team ranking system for fantasy football that is widely believed to be superior to more common formats. The overall standings for each league are determined by a triple-tiered Power Rankings system in which each team is ranked by (a) H2H Record, (b) Total Points Scored, and (c) Breakdown Record (a H2H metric which acts as if each team played every other team in the league in a matchup each week). With 12 teams in each league, Power Rankings points are assigned from 12-1 in each of the three scoring categories, meaning a team leading the league in all three categories would have a 36 Power Score in the standings (such a perfect score has only been achieved by five teams in what have now been 21 combined seasons). Other ALA format wrinkles include a Flex Position in which a QB, RB, or WR can be used no more than six times over the course of the season; Bonus Pools for High Score, Bad Beat, and Upset Victories; and a weekly newsletter from the Commish which highlights the past week's action.
