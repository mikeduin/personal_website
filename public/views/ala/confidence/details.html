        <td class="details left-align" style="padding-top:0px"> In the <b>NFL Confidence Pool</b>, each entrant will pick the straight-up winner of each NFL game each week and rank those picks from most- to least-confident. That means that if there are, say, 15 games in a given week, each entrant would assign point values from 15-to-1 to each pick he is making, giving 15 points to the pick they are most confident in, 14 points to the pick they are next-most confident in, etc., all the way down to one point for the pick they are least confident in. For each correct pick an entrant makes, they earn however many points they assigned to that game. Highest cumulative score for the year wins.  </td>
