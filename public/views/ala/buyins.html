        Many of ALA's fantasy games and pools utilize a <b>dynamic "choose your buy-in" system </b>to accommodate both the casual and serious gamer (or gambler). Entrants are eligible to win only a percentage of the prize pool proportionate to their buy-in amount. This system has multiple benefits: it allows entrants who would like to wager more to do so without pushing out those who would rather keep their buy-in small, and with different prizes for each buy-in tier, it also can encourage entrants to stay active even if they are not in contention for one of the base-tier prizes.

        For an example of how this works, take a look at the payout summary from the 2015 NCAA Pick'em Pool:

        In this game, there are three buy-in options -- $30, $50, or $100 -- which correspond to the three prize tiers in the right half of the table. Each entrant's buy-in is noted to the left of their name. Alex Kurian, the pool winner, bought in for $50, so he received the first-place prizes for both Tier 1 and Tier 2. Dave Echenoz, who finished in 2nd-place and bought in for $30, received the 2nd-place prize just for Tier 1. And since Kyle Davis, who finished in 3rd-place, bought in for $100 ... he received the 3rd-place prize for Tier 1, the 2nd-place prize for Tier 2 (since Dave only bought in for $30), and the 1st-place prize for Tier 3 (since neither Alex nor Dave bought in for $100).
