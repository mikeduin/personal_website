        <td class="details text-left" style="padding-top:0px"> Calcutta Auctions are one of the most recent and exciting additions to the ALA empire. A Calcutta Auction is an open, uncapped auction for participants or teams in a sporting event, which are drawn at random with an opening bid of $1. The winning bidder then "owns" that team or player for the remainder of the competition -- unless they choose to trade or sell parts or full shares of their asset(s), which they are free to do at any time. Prizes are paid out based on a predetermined percentage of the prize pool, depending on how each participant performs. Please see the <a ui-sref="home.ala.calcutta.explainer">Calcutta Auction Explainer</a> for a more in-depth explanation. ALA utilizes outstanding free software for a smooth auction experience on your computer or your mobile phone, and we have a dedicated clan of participants who routinely battle wits in Calcutta Auctions for March Madness, PGA Tournaments, season-long football, and whatever else we happen to feel like gambling on.</td>
