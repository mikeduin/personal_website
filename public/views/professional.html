      Battle the Bookies was my "capstone" project at Galvanize, built in two weeks at the end of the course and meant to demonstrate my ability to build a full-stack web application from start to finish in that timeframe. The game itself is an adaptation of an <a ui-sref="home.ala.btb.details">A Level Above game</a> that runs during the football season; my capstone version requires each entrant to make a theoretical bet on every game in the Major League Baseball season. By making calls to a sports odds API at near-constant intervals, the app updates the odds for each game in live fashion, which added a new strategic element to the game that enables entrants to time their picks based on how they anticipate the real-life odds will move (which was not possible in the game's original, static-odds/Excel incarnation). The app also features daily and year-to-date standings and results, as well as analytics for each user which detail their pick tendencies over the course of the season. Battle the Bookies was built with the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, and Node.js) and incorporates Materialize for styling, JSON Web Tokens for authentication, and ZingCharts to display user analytics.
