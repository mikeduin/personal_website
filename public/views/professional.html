      Battle the Bookies was my "capstone" project at Galvanize, built in two weeks at the end of the course and meant to demonstrate my ability to build a full-stack web application from start to finish in that timeframe. The game is an adaptation of an <a ui-sref="home.ala.btb.details">A Level Above game</a> that runs during the football season; my capstone version requires each entrant to make a theoretical bet on every game in the Major League Baseball season. By making calls to a sports odds API at near-constant intervals, the app updates the odds for each game in live fashion, which added a new element to the game -- one not possible in its original static-line/Excel incarnation -- allowing entrants to strategically time their picks based on how they anticipate real-life odds might move. The app also features daily and year-to-date standings and results, complete selection histories for each entrant, and user analytics which detail each entrant's pick tendencies over the course of the season. Battle the Bookies was built with the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, and Node.js) and incorporates Materialize for styling, JSON Web Tokens for authentication, and ZingCharts.

      NervousDonut is a fun, simple exercise in creative writing and was the result of our Q2 Group Project at Galvanize. Once users have signed up, they are able to begin writing stories based on three random images generated by the Unsplash API. Upon completion, user entries are then saved to a database and posted to the Stories page for all the world to see, and visitors to the site can rate other users' writing through 'likes.' Within the Stories page are sections for both the top-rated and most recently-generated stories. Nervous Donut was built with a Node/Express backend, PostgreSQL for database support, Google OAuth for authentication, jQuery, and Pug/Jade for server-side templating.

      TennisTally was my first project at Galvanize and was inspired by a tennis rivalry that I have with a friend; we had always fantasized about having detailed stats for our matches, so I set out to build a program that could produce those for us. Using jQuery, TennisTally allows the user to click one of four buttons for each player at the conclusion of each in-match point, and from those actions tracks the running score of the match along with various statistics. At the conclusion of the match, a user is directed to a page that breaks down each player's performance in ten different categories, and then to a page showing full play-by-play data for the entirety of the match. In the near future, I am planning to convert TennisTally to run on wearable hardware (such as an Apple Watch) so that the buttons can be pressed by the players themselves rather than a neutral observer.
