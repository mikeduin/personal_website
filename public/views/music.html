    These playlists are the soundtrack to my life. I love and listen to a lot of music, blah blah blah ... If you like what you hear, give 'em a Follow and add them to your own Spotify collection*.

    I've put my 15-20 favorite songs at the top of each playlist ... becuase that's how they're shown be default within Spotify's embedding and to give you an idea of how the rest of the playlist sounds.

    The playlists are ordered below by tempo -- from "deep contemplation" to "dance-like-a-crazy-person."

    *if you are a music fan and you don't have a Spotify Premium subscription, you're doing it wrong...

      The slowest playlist of the lot might be my favorite; it's full of unfathomably beautiful music and ideal for studying or late-night relaxation/contemplation.

      A chilled-out, soothing electronic playlist that's great to listen to while you work; its tracks have enough energy to keep you upbeat and focused, but not so much as to make you want to go out and start pounding beers.

      For when you need to slow down. Stacked with slow-moving acoustic guitars and gorgeous, melodic indie tracks. My go-to playlist when I'm cooking dinner at home.

      This is an uber-playlist where I toss both songs that don't easily fit into one of the other playlists, and many others that do. Good when you don't know what to listen to or are in the company of friends with a variety of music tastes.

      Feel like taking a time-machine back to the angst-ridden, emotional roller coaster that was your adolescence? You've come to the right place. Songs are chronologically organized by album release date, and I stuck to a few rules: there could be no more than three songs from any one album; that album had to have been released between 1998 and 2005; and any song that wasn't inherently whiny and introspective was disqualified. A detailed breakdown of the playlist's contents can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YPe3meN1KGyTjIrIpOrQI1YIyOhAyZ6T-SPYrUexXxI/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">here</a>.

      Uplifting, melodic electro beats in the spirit of Group Therapy. Do you ever see those people at concerts who are staring into the heavens with their eyes-closed, belting out lyrics at the top of their lungs? They actually probably have headphones in and are listening to this playlist.
